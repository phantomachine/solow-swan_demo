# solow-swan_demo

This Python code repository demonstrates the transitional dynamics of an example Solow-Swan model economy (with no TFP growth). We have normalize TFP to unity here, :math:`A = 1`.

Without TFP growth, the economy eventually remains at a rest point: per-capita capital or per-capita GDP will get stuck forever at a constant level.

Python script:

* solowswan1.py

To run this file:

* Have a working version of Python, e.g., install it from (https://www.continuum.io/downloads)[https://www.continuum.io/downloads]

* Launch the IPython terminal (use the Anaconda Launcher if you are a Windows user, or, type **ipython** in your Terminal App in Mac or Linux)

* At the IPython prompt, navigate to where you have stored **solowswan1.py** and then type **run solowswan1**

## Exercise:

The eager student is encouraged to clone this repository and generalize this code to allow for a case where TFP $A$ can grow, e.g., at some constant rate.

## FAQ:

Is coding required in this course? Is this material examinable?

A: No, and no. But the ability to work with math and analytical thinking, and translate your thinking into computer code, will be a very important marketable skill for the modern market place. If you want to go for Honours Year in Economics, learn coding early on and do more math early on!
